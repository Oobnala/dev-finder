### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to implement a dark and light theme switch animation using Sass. In addition, I used this project to practice with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and React.

### Continued development

Areas that I want to continue improving is writing cleaner code and Sass/CSS concepts. This project allowed me to practic CSS Flexbox and Grid which I still need work on. Also, I want to work on my approach for implementing a responsive design. For this project, I used a desktop-first workflow. I plan on doing a mobile-first workflow for my next project.
